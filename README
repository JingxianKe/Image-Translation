Pix2Pix GAN for Image Translation


upscale low-resolution images to a higher resolution

We are essentially converting an image belonging to
the input data distribution to that of an image belonging to
the output data distribution. In today’s technology world,
translation problems pertaining to computer vision are very common,
which amplifies the importance of today’s topic.


we will apply building a Pix2Pix GAN to
build real images from segmentation maps using the cityscapes dataset
hosted by UC Berkeley.
This dataset contains paired sets of segmentation masks and
their corresponding real images of cityscapes.

It is important to note that image translation
can be divided into two categories:
Paired translation and unpaired translation.
Our task today falls under paired translation since
specific segmentation masks will correspond to
specific real objects.
